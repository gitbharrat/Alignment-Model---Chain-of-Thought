    "    Problem Description:\n",
    "    - You will receive an array of examples. Each example is a dictionary containing an \"input\" and \"output\" pair.\n",
    "    - Your task is to identify the core pattern or principle that maps inputs to outputs.\n",

    "    Constraints:\n",
    "    - Do not replicate solutions already present in the provided \"solutions\" array.\n",
    "    - Ensure your solutions are logically valid and adhere to any specific constraints mentioned in the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning Framework:\n",
    "    - Treat this task like a reasoning tree:\n",
    "        - The root represents the primary goal: to map inputs to outputs effectively.\n",

    "    Guidelines for Solution Generation:\n",
    "    - Favor symmetry and simplicity; humans tend to appreciate solutions with these qualities.\n",

    "    You are a discriminator, an assistant responsible for critically evaluating solutions generated by another AI model.\n",
    "    Your primary objective is to verify the correctness, logic, and alignment of the solutions with the problem constraints.\n",
    "    Additionally, if possible, provide a simple, unique hint that can guide towards better solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Problem Description:\n",
    "    - You will be provided with:\n",
    "        - An array of examples, each consisting of an \"input\" and \"output\" pair.\n",
    "        - A solution generated by another AI model.\n",
    "        - A list of already tested solutions for reference.\n",

    "        1. Accurately maps the inputs to the outputs as demonstrated in the given examples.\n",
    "        2. Does not replicate any solution or reasoning already present in the tested solutions array.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Testing Methodology:\n",
    "    1. **Brutal Validation:**\n",
    "        - Check the solution rigorously against the given examples.\n",
    "        - If even one example is incorrect or the mapping is inconsistent, reject the solution outright.\n",
    "        - Confirm that the solution is not a duplicate of any existing solutions in the array.\n",
    "    2. **Complexity Assessment:**\n",
    "        - Verify if the reasoning and solution align with human-like simplicity and intuition:\n",
    "            - Humans prefer simple, easily understandable solutions that follow a top-down approach.\n",
    "            - If the solution is overly complex or convoluted, it is likely unsuitable as a human-like solution.\n",
    "        - Ensure the solutionâ€™s complexity does not surpass what is necessary to solve the problem effectively.\n",
    "    3. **Hint Generation (if possible):**\n",
    "        - If you can identify a unique and simple hint that aligns with the problem constraints and examples:\n",
    "            - Ensure the hint does not completely overlap with the provided solutions, though slight overlaps are acceptable.\n",
    "            - Hints should guide towards better reasoning or a possible improvement in the solution while remaining concise.\n",
    "    4. **Score Assignment:**\n",
    "        - Assign a score based on the quality of the solution:\n",
    "            - Higher scores for solutions that are correct, simple, and intuitive.\n",
    "            - Lower scores for solutions that are overly complex, even if correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Output Format:\n",
    "    - Provide your evaluation and hint in the following structured format:\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"result\": True or False,  # True if the solution is valid, False otherwise\n",
    "        \"score\": floating value between 0 and 1,  # Reflecting the quality of the solution\n",
    "        \"reason\": \"Detailed explanation of why the solution was accepted or rejected, including evaluation of correctness, simplicity, and originality.\",\n",
